  Quiz 2: Compute sta function and Quiz 2 code compute the spike-triggered average of a blowfly H1 neuron from the lab of Dr Robert de Ruyter van Steveninck
  
  Quiz 3: NeuralDecoding takes a hypothetical neuron's response to two stimuli as input and determines the threshold that the decision should be made for stimulus 1 or 2 given the neuron's firing rate. The diagnose function determines whether a person should be diagnosed with an illness given a test result, the test's accuracy, and the rarity of the disease using the ML and MAP criteria.
  
  Quiz 4: Entropy computes the total and noise entropies for a hypothetical neuron in response to a stimulus S and the mutual information. Cricket determines the tuning curves for four hypothetical cricket cercal cells and decodes the population vector in response to a mystery stimulus.

  Quizzes 5-6: intFireNoise simulates a simple neuron and plots interspike intervals. Networks demonstrates a feedforward network and calcuates the steady-state voltage of a recurrent network.
